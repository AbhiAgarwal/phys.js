Phys is a Physics library built for Javascript & NodeJS. It's currently being developed by Abhi Agarwal - [@AbhiAgarwal](https://twitter.com/abhiagarwal)

Information
====

Phys is a library created for individuals who want to use simple or advanced physics functions in their day-to-day work. This library includes functions for:

    - Mechanics
    - Thermal Physics
    - Oscillations and Wave Theory
    - Electric Current and Electromagnetic Induction
    - Fields, Forces and Motions in Fields
    - Energy, power, and climate change
    - Atomic and Nuclear Physics
    - Quantum Physics

Uses
====

Phys is a module in node so it's pretty simple to integrate and start using. With node you're able to declare it as follows:

    var phys = require('phys');

Now for example, if you want to use the Mechanics library you're able to just call the functions with the input numbers:

    phys.mechanics.forceMomentum(2, 3);

Tests
====

Test for the different functions in the Phys Library. To run the tests install:

    "Mocha" - "npm install -g mocha"

Run "mocha" on the main directory.

    Terminal: "mocha" 

It will automatically test the different functions, and display the results on the Terminal.
