Contributing to Phys.JS is simple and easy. Just be sure to use the guidelines, and utilize the tools we used to create this library.

##Guidelines

When contributing please make sure you're using our guidelines:

- Semicolons
- Use already existing functions in basic.js (or add to them)
- Writing Documentation
- Writing to our Information section
- Writing Tests

Please read some of our code before hand to get a feel for the syntax we use.
