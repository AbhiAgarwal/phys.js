List of things to fix
===

Version 0.0.1

- Finish the following libraries with tests:

    - ~~Mechanics (24 Functions)~~
    - ~~Thermal Physics (9 Functions)~~
    - ~~Oscillations and Wave Theory~~
    - ~~Electric Current and Electromagnetic Induction~~
    - ~~Fields, Forces and Motions in Fields~~
    - ~~Energy, power, and climate change~~
    - ~~Atomic and Nuclear Physics~~
    - Quantum Physics
    - Fix Information

Version 0.0.2

- Being able to rearrange the formulas, and equations,
    for example:

        PV = nRt, rearranging it to: V = (nRt)/P

- Specific Heat Capacity constants,
    for example:

        Copper as a solid has a specific heat capacity of 0.385

- Release SUVAT for Mechanics (Already in Future Branch)

Version 0.0.3 [Not so important updates, yet]

- Make the functions & names easier to remember
- Optimize "mechanics_suvat.js"
