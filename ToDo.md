- Specific Heat Capacity constants,
    for example:

        Copper as a solid has a specific heat capacity of 0.385

- Release SUVAT for Mechanics (Already in Future Branch)

Version 0.0.3 [Not so important updates, yet]

- Make the functions & names easier to remember
- Optimize "mechanics_suvat.js"
